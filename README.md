# Responsive Prtfolio
The Portfolio is designed in Responsive mode to render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 


## Steps

The Bootstrap CSS Framework is used to create a mobile responsive portfolio.

* Created the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, developed the portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images


### Final output

* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns) is used to build the pages.

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

* Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.
